### Network programming With Go

- Choosing a Network Topology
	- hybrid topology
- Bandwidth vs. Latency
	- Bandwidth : amount of data we can send over a network connection in an interval of time
	- Latency : a measure of the time that passes between
		- sending a network resource request and receiving a response
		- e.g. delay that occurs between clicking a link and the site's rendering the resulting page
		- high latency negatively affects user experience


- OSI network model
	- layer 7 Application
	- layer 6 Presentation
	- layer 5 Session
	- layer 4 Transport
	- layer 3 Network
	- layer 2 Data link (Logical link control, Media access control)
	- layer 1 Physical

- Sending Traffic using data Encapsulation
	- payload : data traveling down the stack
